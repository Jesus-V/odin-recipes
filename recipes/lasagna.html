    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that's beloved worldwide for its layers of rich flavors and comforting warmth. 
        At its core, lasagna consists of alternating layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, a savory tomato-based sauce, 
        creamy b√©chamel sauce, and a variety of cheeses, typically mozzarella, Parmesan, and sometimes ricotta. 
        These layers are often interspersed with cooked ground meat such as beef, pork, or sausage, 
        as well as vegetables like onions, garlic, mushrooms, and spinach.</p>
    <p>The pasta sheets are usually pre-cooked before assembly to ensure they are tender and fully cooked by the time the dish
         is baked. Each layer is carefully arranged in a baking dish, creating a hearty and satisfying casserole. 
        The top layer is often finished with a generous sprinkling of cheese, creating a golden, bubbly crust when baked.</p>
